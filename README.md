## Stablecoin Categories/Properties
1. Relative stability (pegged/anchored or floating)
- Pegged stablecoins have their value tied to another asset
- Floating stablecoins use math and other mechanisms to maintain a constant buying power
2. Stability method (governed or algorithmic)
- Algorithmic stablecoins use a transparent math equation or set of code to mint and burn tokens
- Governed stablecoins mint and burn tokens via human intervention
3. Collateral type (endogenous or exogenous)
- Exogenous collateral originates from outside the protocol
- Endogenous collateral originates from inside the protocol
